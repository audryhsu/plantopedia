1. make all of the cruds work
- move make models package
2. create handler struct per mat
- move handler functions out of main

3. createPlant from form
- dev.to uses the ioutil.ReadAll from the request.Body?

Questions:
why doesn't passing in a dburl work, but passing in a dsn does ? are they different ?
